  - Explain briefly why each dish is a good pairing (1â€“2 sentences).

Output your answer as a **JSON array** in the following structure:

[
  {{
    "category": "Lamb",
    "examples": [
      {{
        "food": "Herb-crusted lamb rack with rosemary jus",
        "reason": "The wine's tannin and herbal complexity match the richness of lamb and herbs."
      }},
      {{
        "food": "Slow-braised lamb shank with red wine reduction",
        "reason": "The depth of flavor complements the wine's body and intensity."
      }}
    ]
